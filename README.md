# reSync
An open innovation platform powered by blockchain, where innovators, researchers, and startups can collaborate securely while protecting intellectual property (IP). The platform uses smart contracts to ensure fair attribution, revenue sharing, and IP rights management in a transparent and tamper-proof way.
# Key Features:

- Blockchain-Based IP Protection – Every idea submission is timestamped and recorded on a public or private blockchain, ensuring proof of ownership.
- Decentralized Peer Review & Voting – Community-driven validation of ideas through transparent voting mechanisms to identify the best innovations.
- Cross-Industry Collaboration – Businesses, startups, and researchers can find partners, solve industry challenges, and launch co-developed solutions.
- DAO for Governance – A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) ensures that decision-making is democratic and community-driven.

# Use Cases:

- Startups can share their ideas securely while attracting investors and collaborators.
- Enterprises can crowdsource innovative solutions without the risk of idea theft.
- Researchers can monetize patents and discoveries while ensuring attribution transparency.

# Future Enhancements
- AI-powered plagiarism detection
- NFT-based patents for unique innovations
- Cross-chain integration (Ethereum, BSC)
- Smart Contract Licensing & Revenue Sharing:** Automate licensing deals and ensure fair payouts.
- Tokenized Rewards (INNO Token):** Incentivizing innovation with ERC-20 tokens.
